### 0.8.8
* First usable version.
* Still in BETA, can be buggy.

## Support the developer

While this is not a production ready plugin, I'm hoping this can serve two purposes:

1. Give others a general idea on how to develop using version control
2. Learn how to develop WordPress plugins myself

If this code was useful to you, consider [buying me a cup of coffee](https://cash.me/$celsom3).
